# Databases-and-SQL-for-Data-Science-offered-by-IBM-on-Coursera

This module was part of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate on Coursera.

Throughout this module, I was able to learn the concepts of RDBMS and its role in data analysis.
Some of my key learnings in this module are using the joins, views, stored procedures, and accessing databases with Python.
